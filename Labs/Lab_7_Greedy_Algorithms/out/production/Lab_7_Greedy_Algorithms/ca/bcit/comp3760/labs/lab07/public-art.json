It is a symbol that has circulated in largely provisional terms.  My idea was to formalize the symbol through scale and permanence.  Although its precise origins are not known, the symbol does date back to at least the late 1940s (according to the memory of some senior citizens), which is the beginning of the post 2nd World War period.  Its roots may be linked to the Catholic inscription of East Vancouver culture at that time, home as it was to many Italians, Greeks and Eastern Europeans.  Over the years, the symbol has been adopted as an emblem for East Vancouver as a whole but its appearance has generally been tentative rather than overt.  The lack of overtness is, I feel, symptomatic of the underlying meanings that the symbol expresses.  These meanings have to do with problems of injustice, inequality, subjugation and the trauma of poverty and acculturation, particularly as it relates to immigrant life.  My proposal is for a site that sits on a visually messy and peripheral site in East Vancouver.  The East Vancouver symbol is rendered as a 57 foot sculpture that lights up after dark, the word East and Van encircled by a cross delineation that seems to float all on its own.

A reveal is typically the empty space at the bottom of a wall, where a measured gap is left so the floor and wall do not meet.

Contained in the entire image are four separate scenes, which reflect narratives about monsters and giants based in oral history from the Central Coast. The themes to be taken away from these scenes are Protection, Escape, Rejection, and Balance.\r\n\r\nThe image at the top is titled Raven Meets the Cannibal and the theme of this scene is Protection. The Raven in this scene is both human and bird figure. The Raven is known up and down the coast as a trickster, creator and hero or helper of the people. The figure to the right is known as Baxbaxwalanuksiwe or the Cannibal of the North Door. He is known for keeping humans captive and consuming them. This spirit of consumption can affect humans of all backgrounds. In this image the transformer Raven protects himself and returns the cannibalistic energy of greed and consumption back onto its purveyor. \r\n\r\nThe second scene down depicts Escape. The captive child spirit has found his way out of the basket of the giantess known as the Atsi. Stories of this giant reach up and down the coast, and she goes by many names. My grandfather, Johnny Hanuse, called her \u201cSkwanee.\u201d She is known to steal unsuspecting children as they wander too far from the village. Often in the stories told about her, it is the most overlooked child who devises the plan to elude her. This piece was made to honour all of the Residential School child escapees. Over the years I have heard heroic stories of successful and attempted escapes from these schools, and many more fled within their imaginations. The children wanted to go home.\r\n\r\nThe third scene down contains the story of Rejection. P'kvs also known as the Wildman of the Woods is a forest ghost who tries to charm the living into crossing over into the ghost world. He offers gifts, but they are not what they seem. I feel his spirit parallels many figures and entities we deal with in our world today. Many of us choose to cope with reality by accepting illusions, resulting in suffering and living as a ghost. This piece is a reminder to not fall into the false worlds or take in bad medicine.\r\n\r\nThe final scene at the bottom is the Sisiutl, or double-headed sea serpent also known as Winalagalis. What I learn from this monster is the gift of choice and the need for Balance. The choice to build or destroy, and the choice to love or to hate. This serpent was still feared by many and consumed those who were weak in moral strength, but the greater message of the Sisiutl is that it is a choice to be weak or strong in spirit and mind.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have briefly described the scenes taking place, I also invite the viewer to construct their own narrative. When creating these designs I was conscious that children would be seeing them at bus stops. I wanted to create something that their imaginations could slip into. It is this ability to be free, to wonder, and to dream that was forcibly taken away by the Church and State-run Residential Schools, and it still a battle to hang on to our culture, languages and spiritual practice. I look to our stories for lessons on how to overcome the giants in our path.", "registryid": 573, "descriptionofwork": "'Giants Amoung Us\" explores monsters and giants from Northwest Coast indigenous oral history and how these stories relate to and parallel reconciliation and dealing with present day challenges.", "url": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=573", "type": "Two-dimensional artwork", "status": "No longer in place", "artists": "419", "photocredits": "Amanda Strong"}, "record_timestamp": "2022-03-28T05:23:32.479-07:00"},{"datasetid": "public-art", "recordid": "740a1b24ba21e132fdb80fdd7f646010d159a9f7", "fields": {"ownership": "Privately owned", "registryid": 574, "descriptionofwork": "Ninth Column comprises a 97-foot high structural steel column clad in custom cast panels which bear an exact replica of mature Douglas-fir bark.

This animation technique is central to my practice; it consists in the overlapping of two images generating the illusion of a third image. Each work is produced using this method; two grids of pixels are overlapped and set in motion to generate a digital animated moir\u00e9. Alongside the use of digital moir\u00e9, the animations from RIPPLES display a common visual treatment: Streaks of hard-edged pixels combined to a minimal color palette. This visual treatment gives each animation unique graphical and kinetic qualities, reminiscent of early computer graphics and endemic to screens and matrix display technologies. The RIPPLES animations are initially shown on computer screens. They are published online as animated GIFs displayed full screen on HTML pages. The animations operate as seamless loops with no beginning or end; their duration online is determined by the viewer\u2019s experience. Meanwhile, each animation encourages a contemplative gaze by combining textural and pixelated elements to a mesmerizing and infinite motion. Specifically, the animations from RIPPLES are informed by memories of rainstorm textures, sand patterns and ocean waves. Each animation attempts to emulate visual and behavioural qualities from these atmospheric elements into digital forms. This process happens slowly through a series of visual experimentations; when a visual experiment feels familiar with the natural references, it is developed to enhance and isolate these specific traits. The resulting works appear like distant recollections of the natural, fluctuating between organic form and digital abstraction. The space of the screen oscillates between depth and flatness, natural and synthetic, merging all into a hybrid form. The flat pixelated graphics flood the monitor, the endless motion does not give rest to the eye.

The material traces of these consequences\u2014from remnants of foliage and forests to dried streams of water\u2014are evoked in the work, through both production methods to the imagery and aesthetic. \r\nThe project is an extension of my recent series of unique gelatin silver prints, titled Autograms. The work consists of reproductions of three Autograms resulting in three distinct posters. The project includes images varying in dominant tone (for instance, one that is largely white, one grey, and one black). Creating an overall mood for each poster, this dominant tone can be seen to represent time of day, weather condition, or season. \r\nThese references to time and the natural world are echoed in both the material processes and compositions of the works.

Her focus is the \u201cdark matter\u201d in our midst: people and events that remain just below the threshold of visibility, not because they are impossible to find but because they are difficult for the majority culture to acknowledge due to the systematized racism they expose. Mining overlooked archives, she asks difficult questions about who records history. She reactivates historic documents through a process of extraction, translation and enlargement, and then reinserts this material back into public consciousness in a new form. Over the past two years, Bowen has undertaken exhaustive research in Vancouver to trace a series of intertwined figures who formed an integral part of this city\u2019s Black entertainment community from the 1940s to the end of the 1970s. She mapped a constellation of nightclubs, theatres and hotels where they gathered\u2014 many of which have been erased from the city\u2019s physical fabric and its collective memory, but exist as traces in the archives. Her aim is to bring a more complex Black community into visibility, and to posit a powerful counterpoint to common narratives that oversimplify the city\u2019s Black presence by containing it within the spatial, economic and temporal confines of Hogan\u2019s Alley. Night Prowl captures part of a frame of filmed footage accompanying CBC reportage about Vancouver\u2019s ethnically diverse east end nightclubs that aired on October 14, 1959. Racially-motivated anxieties around such nightclubs\u2014and the neighbourhoods in which they were situated\u2014would fuel the calls for urban renewal that would dramatically displace Black communities in the coming decades. The image, which depicts the neon marquee of a now-forgotten dance club after dark, is interrupted by a series of circular voids: visible fragments of batch numbers punched through the cellulose film at its time of manufacture. The holes are a banal artifact found at the end of any film reel. For Bowen, however, the ruptured cellulose reminds us of film\u2019s fragile materiality, compromises its visual seamlessness and undermines our ability to trust photography\u2019s seductive promise of \u201ctruth.\u201d Considered this way, even blemished and seemingly insignificant documents can be rich repositories for unintended readings, and for questioning who has been charged with writing our histories, and why.Kimberly Phillips, Curator, Contemporary Gallery", "registryid": 803, "descriptionofwork": "THE WALL is a Vancouver Heritage Foundation public art initiative.

This drawing, which depicts individuals with and without masks on, standing on the landscape (actually a translation of the tundra outside Qamani\u2019tuaq, NU, where my family is from), is constructed out of text and was drawn from left to right. The text begins in the upper right with the date and the number of covid cases worldwide at that moment in time. Its stream of consciousness writing, covers my concerns, preoccupations and thoughts around the pandemic, which eventually simultaneously becomes about the killing of George Floyd and concerns for the continued colonial erasures we enact on Indigenous communities, land and place. In the lower left, when the drawing was finished, the date and number of covid cases appears again thereby making the drawing a unique record of a place and time. The figures, drawn by my young daughter, also reflect her preoccupations during the pandemic. She has carefully planned out the spacing between people (with her best understanding of 2 metres), created a family that stands together in their bubble, and has outfitted several of the figures with masks.

In September of 1968, Douglas Brown, a Vancouver lawyer, talked to sculptor Elek Imredy about his desire to commission a sculpture inspired by the famous Copenhagen mermaid, which could be sited on the great granite boulder just off the northern shore of Stanley Park. Imredy proposed a life-size bronze sculpture of a scuba diver. On Brown's initiative, the Vancouver Harbour Improvement Society was formed with the intention of financing and facilitating a unique landmark for both Vancouverites and visitors to the city. They raised the money to produce the sculpture privately and Imredy was commissioned to craft the proposed work. The Vancouver Park Board gave permission to the society to place the sculpture on the rock. Because the boulder was often covered at high tide, a precast concrete ring was created and the rock was lifted by a floating crane and set on the ring about 100 feet from its original location.  Imredy first took a mold of the top surface of the rock. In his studio, he made a replica of the rock and modeled the figure in clay. Imredy asked his young friend Debra Harrington to model, however the sculpture is not recognizably her image. \"When I couldn't get the model to hold her hand the way I wanted it... I held my left hand in front of a mirror, showing its opposite, and I modeled   right one. Of course, I made it a bit nicer, with longer fingers.\" A plaster of paris mold was made from the clay figure and the sculpture was cast in fibreglass. This fibreglass figure was flown to Rome where it was cast in bronze at Giovanni and Angelo Nicci's foundry. On June 9th, 1972, the sculpture was set in place by an electric crane reaching out from shore to the rock 8o feet away and fastened to the stone with stainless steel bolts. The next day the sculpture was ceremoniously unveiled. \"Girl in Wetsuit\" has become a landmark for visitors to Stanley Park and to boats that enter the harbour.", "type": "Sculpture", "status": "In place", "primarymaterial": "Bronze", "artists": "79", "yearofinstallation": "1972", "sitename": "Great Granite Boulder", "siteaddress": "Stanley Park", "photourl": {"id": "5989caf97042374c9ae2bd7bcad2e57e", "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 167, "width": 250, "filename": "LAW97-1.jpg", "thumbnail": true, "format": "JPEG", "color_summary": ["rgba(96, 101, 124, 1.00)", "rgba(105, 122, 164, 1.00)", "rgba(79, 93, 127, 1.00)"]}, "locationonsite": "In water, past Brockton Point, N side of Stanley Park", "geom": {"coordinates": [-123.121984, 49.300579], "type": "Point"}, "neighbourhood": "Stanley Park", "url": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=97"}, "record_timestamp": "2022-03-28T05:23:32.479-07:00"},{"datasetid": "public-art", "recordid": "f8b3a3cc7bbacd79e8516ed0fc310f50a0636bd7", "fields": {"ownership": "City of Vancouver", "artistprojectstatement": "The Empress of Japan sailed between Vancouver and the Orient between 1891 and 1922.

The form of the work takes off from two 18th century navigational instruments: the plane table and David's quadrant.  Chung Hung said that, \"The objective of the sculpture is to create a symbolic image with definite visual expression, awakening an awareness in Captain George Vancouver's contribution to the world, his remarkable and meticulous surveys which included the north Pacific coast.\" The piece frames English Bay from the north view and the Centennial Museum from the south view. The opportunity for a sculpture was offered to the city by Hugh Faulkner, Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs at the time. The project was recommended by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.  A five-member jury headed by former parks superintendent Stuart Lefeaux selected Chung Hung's proposal from a local competition and the Parks Board approved the choice.

There was some adverse reaction from Kits Point residents when the work was installed. Michael Duncan, Chief Curator of the Maritime Museum at the time, called it \"a bloody monstrosity.\" An article in the Globe and Mail teased that it could be \"the world's largest paper clip.\" The article (Mar3, 1981) also quoted from a city planning study which read: \"Vancouver's peerless natural setting is a permanent gift from nature. So massive and close are the North Shore mountains that no amount of human folly can ever obliterate them.\"  But the controversy soon abated and the piece has weathered time and opinion. It was vandalized on July 4th, 1988, when a field of white dots were painted on its surfaces -probably as an art \"intervention\". The dots were soon removed.

A committee was formed in conjunction with Capilano College and a subsequent national competition drew 98 entries. Toronto artist Beth Alber won with the design incorporating 14 pink granite benches in a circle.  It stands as a reminder of violence against women in society.  The competition policies state that, \"The Women's Monument is conceived as a rational monument to be located in Vancouver, BC, dedicated to all women who have been murdered by men, and naming the 14 women killed in Montreal on Dec 6,1989. It will provide a focus for healing and a tangible symbol of remembrance.\" Beth Alber's artist proposal states,  \"The circle, the symbol used by women for centuries to represent a continuum, in a non-hierarchical way, is one of the major elements for this Women's Monument. It is a symbol of women's spirit and is associated with the idea of a protected or consecrated space.\"  During the course of the project, considerable controversy was stirred up by the wording of the inscription which is dedicated to \"all women who have been murdered by men\".  Many people felt this inscription was too political. Some were critical about the eventual cost of the monument, approximately $500,000, which they felt could have been put to better purpose.  Many felt that the monument was too specific and was inappropriately sited in a public place, and that public money shouldn't be used to commemorate what was construed to be a private grief.

The figure faces the direction of the wind as indicated by the four directionals and the tipped arrow upon which it rests. Closer investigation reveals this to be Rodney Graham\u2019s Weathervane sculpture, which depicts the artist dressed as 16th Century humanist and classical scholar, Erasmus. Absorbed in the solitary activity of reading, the figure is lost in thought and contemplation, not having to worry about where he is going or what lies ahead but, as Rodney Graham puts it, is able to \u2018ponder on horseback\u2019  moving forward but also looking backward, to the past.  Rodney Graham based the weathervane on a contemporary anecdote which claimed that Erasmus wrote his most well-known work, The Praise of Folly, on horseback during a journey from Italy to England circa 1510. Graham plays on the absurdism inherent in reading a philosophical treatise on human folly whilst riding on a horse backwards and continues his ongoing philosophical enquiry into cyclical and backward movement; like all his work it contains a complex narrative and is brimful of references: literary, philosophical, self-referential and art historical.  Rodney Graham\u2019s poetic and humourous weathervane, helpfully indicating wind direction and compass points for any serious traveller who looks upward to contemplate the conditions for travel, continues his preoccupation with un-urgent journeying. Erasmus travels from Italy to England leisurely by horseback, the cowboy meanders gently off the beaten track, the buccaneer\u2019s unknown voyage which has thrown him up on a \u201ctreasure island\u201d, and the chemically-induced mental journeys that take place in the artist\u2019s head, remind us even if we are not going anywhere in particular that \u2018the trip is the thing\u2019.\r\n(Rodney Graham in conversation with Iwona Blazwick, Director, Whitechapel Gallery, October 14th 2008\r\n2 Rodney Graham in Rodney Graham, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London 2002 p.109)", "registryid": 430, "descriptionofwork": "Copper sculpture of the artist as the philosopher, Erasmus, seated backwards on a horse reading a book.", "type": "Sculpture", "status": "In place", "primarymaterial": "Copper and steel", "geo_local_area": "Downtown", "artists": "316", "yearofinstallation": "2008", "sitename": "Pomaria", "siteaddress": "1455 Howe Street", "photourl": {"id": "9f2768234f1c142bde58e3f046582041", "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 768, "width": 1024, "filename": "L1.JPG", "thumbnail": true, "format": "JPEG", "color_summary": ["rgba(101, 142, 179, 1.00)", "rgba(107, 139, 168, 1.00)", "rgba(94, 137, 174, 1.00)"]}, "locationonsite": "Third level tower on Pacific Avenue", "geom": {"coordinates": [-123.130832, 49.275678], "type": "Point"}, "neighbourhood": "Downtown", "url": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=430"}, "record_timestamp": "2022-03-28T05:23:32.479-07:00"},{"datasetid": "public-art", "recordid": "6d232759e0fba3e0cca965e6a4b5e7214e4f1314", "fields": {"ownership": "City of Vancouver", "artistprojectstatement": "Park explores the nature and value of public and private space in our urban experience.", "registryid": 431, "descriptionofwork": "Park consists of two mobile, stainless steel sculptural objects each approximately the size and weight of a small automobile.

Uncomfortable when used by only one person, the artwork is best experienced with another person and thus becomes a tool for whimsical social exchange.SeeSawSeat is built with the fulcrum of the bench slighly to one side, so that when then bence is unoccupied, it drops to one side, a clear sign that it is not a fixed bench.

Of course I knew beforehand what the function of the entrance was, with its stairs and escalators. But knowing about the function of something versus experiencing it firsthand are different. The first leads to an objective, factual kind of understanding, while the latter leads one to a more poetic understanding in which analogous connections can come to mind. Seeing the toing and froing of commuters going up and down the stairs and escalators brough to my mind remembered experiences of salmon migrating up the Campbell River and its tributaries and the eventual return of new, young salmon downstream to the ocean. Seeing that event left me unexpectedly, strongly affected. I wanted to see if I might be able to bring some aspect of it into my work. So I began making a series of photographs at the Capilano Hatchery in North Vancouver. When the City of Vancouver Public Art Department approached me regarding the creation of a public artwork, I was in the early stages of collecting images of Salmon. But I had not yet reached a decision on how I would eventually employ these images. The Canada Line project brought this into focus for me. \r\n\r\nI wanted whatever image I created for the Canada Line Station entrance to have a strong connection to the function of the site as well as to life on the Coast of British Columbia. I wanted viewers to be able to recognize and appreciate these connections. Further to this, I hoped to trigger people\u2019s thoughts about these wild creatures and how they have exerted such a powerful effect on the rhythm of life along our coast throughout living memory as well as long before that. They have always been central in our cultures and economies. \r\n\r\nI chose to represent the salmon swimming within a structure that recreates the look of a fish ladder rather than attempting to show them swimming in the wild. I believe this allows viewers to connect my image to the structure and function of the Canada Line entrance, hopefully in a whimsical way. However, the image structure is also meant to allude to our processes for studying the life cycle of salmon, controlling and promoting the continued, healthy reproduction of their various wild species, and ensuring continued future harvests.\r\n\r\nThese fish are full of vitality and a sense of undeterred purpose in the face of all obstacles. They are powerful swimmers that remain wild and mysterious, even when they find themselves channeled through our systems. I have tried to express some of these qualities by catching their images in moments when they are highly animated, swimming through turbulent water filled with swirling bubbles, their bodies dark and unknowable in their watery element.\" - Jim Breukelman, 2013", "registryid": 542, "descriptionofwork": "Five panel colour photographic mural, depicting salmon swimming or resting in a fish ladder filled with foaming, bubble filled, turbulent water.

The area was covered over to make room for Industry and the CPR railway. The attempted erasure of the space by the colonial forces of the time was thorough and it continues to be built upon today. When looking at some of the public art in Vancouver and other cities we often see a romantic depiction of industrial beginnings and labour. What existed before is often covered and ignored. Knowing that my work will live in this space temporarily I feel it is important to acknowledge its history as well as its present-day. Vancouver is built upon unceded land, sacred sites, complex river and stream systems, hunting and cultivated gathering grounds. It is easy to get lost in the feeling of permanence that urban structures hold. The areas we walk, drive and live upon have place-names and a history of lived experiences.I have lived in Vancouver on and off for around 17 years. Since moving here I have been trying to understand my relationship with this place. I am of mixed Coast Salish ancestry (Klahoose and Sliammon) from my grandmother Agnes Pielle, as well as Wuikinuxv and Kwakwaka'wakw from my grandfather Johnny Hanuse. As a youth I learned that my Grandmother's Nations were historically unified with the Nations here and visually our iconography shares links. The relationship between Nations experienced rupture as a result of colonization. Visually it is important for me to work in continuum with my ancestors. It is also important for me to note that these images do not represent the space they will temporarily live upon, but reflect a relationship and respect for the land and water that my ancestors carried. I strive to continue in this mode of reverence for the spaces we come from and live upon. I also want to recognize my place as an uninvited guest in this space and continue to gain further understanding of it in my time here.An important part of the process in making these pieces has been listening. I have been in conversation with Skwxw\u2019u7mesh artist/knowledge keepers T'uy'tanat (Cease Wyss) and her partner Xuuyaa, as well as other respected community members in the lead up to installing these pieces.

It aims to highlight a sense of community despite visible economic and cultural diversity of the neighbourhood. The form is inspired by animals from the Strathcona neighbourhood, the historical precedent of narrative bronze doors in relief, and the phenomenon of \u201cHead in the Hole\u201d photo boards. Conceptually, it responds to the colour and texture in the community (particularly the murals), and the desire to identify oneself as part of a community. Bronze doors are heavy and have a ceremonial quality. Often covered in narrative reliefs, they are an early form of storytelling. What is the narrative here at the Library? The name, n\u0259\u04d9\u0301ca\u0313 \u0294mat ct, loosely translates as \u201cwe are one\u201d in the Musqueam language, and the artwork responds to this sentiment. Introducing animals into the artwork is a way to identify all the library patrons as \u201cone\u201d across a loose geographic area without picking out and representing cultural differences which, while is important to celebrate diversity, becomes tricky when it becomes a symbol of ownership and belonging. We all have an innate desire see ourselves in the world around us and understand that we belong somewhere. Through identifying with a character, a cultural symbol or in the capturing of a moment that contains us (the selfie), we place ourselves within acertain context. The artwork takes the form of \u02bbHead in hole\u02bc photo board to create a situation in which people of all ages can simultaneously identify with a character/animal, and see themselves within it.

Excavations expresses the challenge of piecing together a complete history through the archive and its inherent biases, while also retaining the complexity of Vancouver\u2019s history and ever-changing built environment.After reviewing a large selection of the city\u2019s archival photographs, certain narratives around settlement and industry persisted in the historical documentation. Given Vancouver\u2019s extensive pre-colonial, Indigenous history, questions regarding the under-represented communities and narratives in the archive informed the artist\u2019s approach to producing the image. What history can be understood and given form when the archival material reflects a certain vantage point?Looking at the historical photographs, it is difficult to situate their locations within the city due to the dramatic changes that have occurred in Vancouver\u2019s evolution from a frontier town to a major international hub. With the urban renewal programs of the 1960s, the development of the waterfront for Expo 86, the current housing bubble, amongst many other changes, the city of Vancouver is in constant flux. The majority, if not all, of the buildings used to create this image no longer exist, pointing to the disappearance of countless older properties, creating an historical amnesia.

Concerns of the environment and social responsibility weave through his work, and for this project Waqif has created an immersive architectural experience built out of materials collected from repurpose stores, the transfer station and landfill in the metro Vancouver area. The structure is assembled using timber, roofing, doors, window frames and sections of walls salvaged from recent demolitions and discarded from local residential and office building.Many of Waqif\u2019s projects respond to an absence of a tactile, experiential aspect in contemporary art by establishing an element of interactivity inside a living, evolving, organic environment. At Offsite he installs mechanical and electronic panels into his maze-like structures to cultivate a multi-sensory experience with sound, light and movement.

The image has been captured by a thermal imaging camera, normally used by the construction industry, which has been designed to display differences in temperature by detecting light rays that are invisible to the human eye.Most PNE fairgoers are familiar with the Livestock Building, entering through one of its many barn doors along its south side to cheer on the baby pig races, pet the chickens, llamas and rabbits, and ogle animals large and small. What is not so evident when wandering through this expansive space was its change of use in 1942 when the grounds, then known as Hastings Park, were expropriated by the Department of National Defense.With the declaration of war against Japan, the Government of Canada evoked the War Measures Act and authorized removal of \u201call persons of Japanese racial origins,\u201d from the west coast \u201cprotected area\u201d of British Columbia, even though the majority were Canadian born and Naturalized Canadians. Some 22,000 Japanese Canadians, then labeled \u201cenemy aliens,\u201d were uprooted from their homes and sent to various sites, including internment camps, road construction camps and sugar beet farms in the BC interior, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario. All personal properties, such as fishing boats, farms, businesses and homes, were confiscated and sold without owners\u2019 consent to cover the costs of their internment.Beginning in March 16, 1942, some 8,000 persons, removed from fishing, lumber and mining villages along the north coast and Vancouver Island, were held at Hastings Park while campsites to which they were eventually transferred were being developed. The stables and cattle stalls of the Livestock Building were converted into a makeshift women and children\u2019s dormitory. Other structures were used as boys and men\u2019s dorms, mess halls, kitchen, hospital and isolation ward. Young men were separated from their families, and sent to work at road camp sites. By September, 1942, there were 3,866 women, men and children living in various buildings on thissite.The archival photograph is from a series that local photographer LeonardFrank was contracted to document for the BC Security Commission, which was created in 1942 to oversee the internment process.

At the peak of this glowing epoch there were thousands of electrified gas filled glass tubes in the Terminal City\u2019s neon jungle. A big hiccup in this brightlights-big-city story came with the blackouts of WWII when civil defence restrictions lead to a new category of no neon outdoor advertising known as \u201cSpectaculars.\u201dWhen McGavin\u2019s Bakery approached Neon Products for an animated neon of Mother Hubbard\u2019s bread, a \u201cSpectacular\u201d was suggested instead. A hand of enormous proportions was proposed, roughly the same size as the Statue of Liberty\u2019s, but instead of grasping the eternal flame of freedom, Mother Hubbard\u2019s digits would raise on high a leviathan loaf of liberty bread! Genius! McGavin\u2019s, a big supporter of Victory Bonds, approved.Ironically, work on the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf didn\u2019t begin until after blackout restrictions had been lifted at the end of the war. Progress slowed when McGavin\u2019s roof required fortification supporting the added weight. Then the \u201cSpectacular\u201d installers were unavailable, preoccupied by a Log Cabin Cookies billboard featuring a real log cabin with smoking chimney and Mom inside whipping up maple creams. Finally in September 1948, the \u201cSpectacular\u201d crew convened on the roof of McGavin\u2019s and over the next four months assembled the sheet metal loaf and concrete mixed with vermiculite hand, and a cuff hiding the steel bridgework. The finished Giant Hand &amp; Loaf stood atop McGavin\u2019s bakery from 1949 through 1973.When Henri Robideau photographed the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf in February 1973, its cuff had blown away in a wind storm and one of its fingers had rotted off. This image became the first in his life-long photographic study of humanity\u2019s attraction to bigness, a new science he called Gianthropology. He conducted Gianthropological Digs along the Pacific cordillera throughout the 1970\u2019s, culminating in the 1980 exhibition Giant Things, featuring the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf as its signature image. Expanding on that huge success he launched the Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey, portaging around Canada in the 1980\u2019s, photographing the monumental in the form of panoramic images.", "registryid": 847, "descriptionofwork": "The WALL is a Vancouver Heritage Foundation public art initiative.

Central to the proposition of these large-scale outdoor drawings is a concern for what I consider to be drawing&rsquo;s most essential quality; the material presence of line. The rich and long tradition of mosaics is its engagement with and consideration for, process, material and line. A material and process based approach means the drawing must not only be responsive to the architecture, but germane to the community and pertinent to the site. These figural, columnar figures will be captured as modern day caryatides. A considered presence, the figures will be defined and be understood by both the present activities and people that surrounds them today as well as from those the past (history of Leslie House). Solitary and reaching, these gentle and quiet giants will be formidable but not intimidating, abstract yet recognizable, subscribers to no other narrative but the one passersby and visitors choose to impose.

The work includes three distinct audio tracks, installed at specific locations within the plaza. Specialized directional speakers are integrated into the ceiling panels, producing a highly controlled sound &ldquo;column&rdquo; that visitors walk into and out of at will. Customized paving on the ground plane visually identifies the location of the work.\r\n\r\nThe audio tracks are a series of collaborative texts/stories, gleaned from fourteen writers from around the city that, when taken together, weave narratives that define lives lived in proximity: restlessness and care. Each speaker reveals a randomized program of short narratives that span past, present and future: the work invites listeners to explore the ideas of Restless Futures (Speaker A), Speculative Pasts (Speaker B) and Instructions for Care in the present (Speaker C). Owing to programming by Remy Siu and responsive sound design by Antoine B&eacute;dard, each speaker retains a constantly shifting presence; each listener experiences a unique sequence of narrative and sound.\r\n\r\nThe narratives are drawn from emerging and established writers, including Lorna Brown, Lili Robinson, Amber Dawn, Aryo Khakpour, James Long, Maiko Yamamoto, Whess Harman, Amiel Gladstone, Jus-tine A. Chambers, Cease Wyss, Vanessa Kwan, Hiromi Goto, Faith Sparrow-Crawford, and Tim Carlson.\r\n\r\nThe use of sound relates to the artist team&rsquo;s interest in creating experiences in public space that draw attention to ideas, histories and subjectivities that lie beneath the surface of the city: quite literally the things we can&rsquo;t see.

In an era of gatekeeping national borders; rising violence directed towards  immigrants and refugees; and persisting conditions of systemic racial violence, the series juxtaposes national landmarks and marked lands with protest to confront the tenuous conditions of cultural assimilation and belonging, as well as propose measures of resistance and resilience.  \r\n\r\nInformed by a lifetime of movement through the United States, Canada, and South Korea, Josephine Lee&rsquo;s interdisciplinary practice is heavily informed by the psychic violence of cultural assimilation and naturalization through migration.

Within this framework, Lee&rsquo;s materials and forms  both signify and complicate overlapping identity formations, and notions of home and belonging.

There is a certain fictional quality to the term \u201ccoastal city\u201d, metaphorically on the verge of the imaginary, the otherworldly, the historic and the futuristic. \u201cFrom a distance, the work mines the history of travel books from the early 19th century Baedekers to more recent and popular guides such as Lonely Planet and Frommers. While these guidebooks are meant as references for the worldly globetrotter, they nonetheless fulfill the desires of armchair vacationers and urban travellers alike. Upon closer inspection, one notes that the poster is a composite of two images. The smaller of the two images is an excerpt from a larger print, an ocean wave pattern from a woodblock print by Japanese ukiyo-e master Toyohara Kunichika (1835-1900) from a series of prints depicting shipwrecks. \u201cUkiyo\u201d is a Japanese term meaning \u201cthe floating world\u201d, a reference to the pleasure-seeking urban lifestyles of Edo-period Japan (1600-1867). The larger image is a photograph of Vancouver\u2019s False Creek shoreline with objects introduced into the image. One might ask: what is an ikat fabric, a piece of imari-inspired china and a silvered cruciform-topped cruet stopper doing on the shoreline? And what could it all mean?\r\nVancouver Coastal: a nomad\u2019s guide to the floating world\u201d is a work that references contemporary and historic nomadic life. Recent events involving travel, global weather patterns and natural occurrences in the Far East and our own West Coast shores have shown evidence of unexpected material and climactic exchange resulting in an archaeological array of accidental artefacts washing up on all shorelines along the Pacific. After all, cultural exchange is not limited to capitalistic trade. These artefacts are accidental travellers, nomadic ephemera that unwittingly influence our cultural landscape and a testimony to the independent life of objects. As the primordial ocean is the birthplace of life, the coastline is the threshold of humanity, our culture and our civilization. As the knowledge of our culture expands through the exchange of ideas, the history of trade can partly be told through the history of our coastline. From anecdotes predating the Galleon Trade1 to our present-day container cargo ships, our waterways and oceans tell the story of cultural exchange, some through trade while others through natural happenstance. \u201cVancouver Coastal: a nomad\u2019s guide to the floating world\u201d is both laden with truth and a work of fiction made possible through subjective and speculative storytelling.

You can drive a car right through it!\u201d I remember always thinking of what an affront to nature it was to use a car as a standard of bigness, but that was the early twentieth century. Later in the century, in 1995, I was in Ireland and phoning home for voicemail messages and had one from my mother that said, \u201cHi Dear, Constable So-and-so from the Vancouver Police phoned to ask if you\u2019d deliberately left your VW parked inside the Hollow Tree in Stanley Park before you left and, to be honest, with you we never know, so could you give him a ring?\u201d My car had been stolen from an underground parkade and abandoned in the tree by joyriders.\r\n \r\n    In 2006 Stanley Park\u2019s Hollow Tree, an 800-year-old Western red cedar stump, was damaged in a particularly bad storm, and the City of Vancouver made a stab at removing it. I don\u2019t know what they were thinking. Everyone in the city went crazy. The Hollow Tree is where people had their grad photos taken. It\u2019s where they had their first kiss; it\u2019s where everybody takes their relatives from overseas. In 2009 the Hollow Tree Conservation Society, funded entirely by private donations, stabilized the tree, and in October 2011 it was restored as well as possible, and made open to the public. I was pretty supportive of this project but years later I\u2019m looking at the tree and I can see its days are numbered. It\u2019s a piece of dead wood hundreds of years old. It\u2019s rotting. It\u2019s nature. So I wondered, \u201cWhy not transform the tree? Why not put it through a mirror and have it come out the other side as a mythical entity?\u201d This is what I did with the Golden Tree at the corner of SW Marine Drive and Cambie Street. It\u2019s a mirror of something that once was \u2014 and will still be for a little while \u2014 and it establishes the existence of an evolving city that has an evolving sense of nature and ecosystems.

I work with painting as a process of thought. I believe that the physicality of the work and its indexicality of painted marks and gestures (subtle touches, rough scumbles, offhanded smears and studied glazes, etc.) vicariously open this exploratory thinking to an audience.\r\n\r\nI am interested in the physiology of perception and how it is personally and culturally codified. My work considers how the world is realized through pictures: that how we picture the world (and how we are taught to picture the world) is how the world becomes. And I consider that if the resolution of a painting-object can be delayed and the process of perception is held open, a maker/viewer may discover agency there. For me the experience of making and looking at the painted object are intimately aligned with the scenes and experiences that I represent. This is a productive alignment. I confuse and equate the space of painting with the space of the world.\r\n\r\nARTWORK STATEMENT\r\n\r\nThe painted image for this work is a view through trees (on the border of urban and &lsquo;natural&rsquo; spaces) of Burrard Inlet at the start of s\u0259li\u0313 lw\u0313 \u0259t (Indian Arm). It is seen from an imaginary vantage point: a view that doesn&rsquo;t exist.

The six successful applicant teams were reviewed and chosen by a selection panel of Indigenous artists and art professionals.The projects were realized throughout the city centre, including projects at the central library, Queen Elizabeth Theatre and its plaza, the headhouse of a Canada Line station, a laneway on the Downtown Eastside, and the lot where the Kanata Fest and the Drum Is Calling Festival were held.Works variously drew from Coast Salish, formline, and Woodland School forms, presented portraits mixing contemporary and traditional clothing and regalia, and collaged photographic images into abstracted compositions.Commissioned in the spirit of Reconcilation, the project served to increase Indigenous visibility on the unceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations now known as Vancouver.", "type": "Mural", "status": "No longer in place", "geo_local_area": "Downtown", "artists": "582", "photocredits": "Rachel Topham", "yearofinstallation": "2017", "sitename": "Canada Line - Vancouver City Centre Station", "siteaddress": "Georgia & Granville Street", "photourl": {"id": "9a5782fa21b7bc7ecc93c0a144539a64", "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 768, "width": 1024, "filename": "LGranville Mural_01.jpg", "thumbnail": true, "format": "JPEG", "color_summary": ["rgba(170, 167, 170, 1.00)", "rgba(116, 110, 100, 1.00)", "rgba(178, 160, 145, 1.00)"]}, "geom": {"coordinates": [-123.119083, 49.281865], "type": "Point"}, "neighbourhood": "Downtown", "url": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=744"}, "record_timestamp": "2022-03-28T05:23:32.479-07:00"},{"datasetid": "public-art", "recordid": "0b17c6efa8ad48ee44d25ee25d5d180b94f24620", "fields": {"ownership": "New Edgewater Development ULC", "artistprojectstatement": "The artwork is inspired from the saying that soft fire makes sweet melt.

The initial concept for the sign came from viewing large driftwood logs tossed up on rocks along the beach near the Vancouver Maritime Museum. The large horizontal cedar log was cut from a tree blown down by strong winds in Stanley Park, salvaged and donated by the City of Vancouver. The log has been set onto boulders excavated from the old Carling O'Keefe Brewery site at 12th Avenue and Arbutus, and donated by Intergulf Development Group.The vertical log sculpture is composed of 3 layers of upright logs stepping up and back from the viewer. The first carving on the front set of logs portrays a Coast Salish village with cedar plank houses and beached canoes, a scene which may have been typical around this area prior to European settlement.The carving on the second layer of logs portrays past and present roots of Kitsilano, including a traditional corner store, craftsman-style houses, adn Engine 374, which pulled the first transcontinental train into Vancouver in 1887, was retired to Kitsilano Park for many years, and is now on display in the Roundhouse Community Centre. Also portrayed on this layer is the Vancouver Museum and Pacific Space Centre.The third layer of carved logs portrays a view north across English Bay to Stanley Park, Vancouver's West End, and the North Shore mountains - a scene which is typical from almost any viewpoint in the Kitsilano area.The sign was designed by Kitsilano resident Jim Kostyniuk and carved by BC artist Pete Ryan.

Mother and Child focuses on the idea of the family and is sited at the heart of the new development in the public park adjacent to the new daycare centre. This pair of sculptures hopes to foster through its biomorphic shapes, tactile material and series of openings, social and physical activity by encouraging children, teens and adults to interact with the work. The proposed work echoes the Fraser Commons&rsquo; ambition to create a family friendly and calm inviting space from which to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.\r\n\r\nOften regarded as the father of modern British sculpture, Henry Moore and his longtime friend, colleague and fellow sculptor Barbara Hepworth have been, time and again, a source of inspiration for my artistic work. In this instance, Mother and Child draws upon the artists&rsquo; use of abstraction of human and natural forms along with the recurring motif of the family. Like the work of Moore and Hepworth, the sculptures will be situated within the green space of the park and will act as a frame for the landscape.\r\n\r\nMother and Child is equally influenced by the post war &lsquo;play sculptures&rsquo; of British sculptor John Bridgeman (1916 &ndash; 2004) and Danish architect and sculptor Egon M&ouml;ller-Nielsen (1915 &ndash; 1959). Bridgeman and M&ouml;ller-Nielsen&rsquo;s play-sculpture hybrids are models for the work&rsquo;s sense of playfulness and will help to animate the space and humanize the architectural design of the new Fraser Commons.\r\n\r\nThe choice of traditional cast bronze is a nod to the works of these modernist masters, but is also motivated by my desire to encourage physical interaction, touching and movement through the works on the part of the viewer whose contact contributes to its changing patina. The sculpture&rsquo;s blue finish is informed by my childhood memories of the old Blue Boy Motel Hotel formerly located on the site. The colour provides something of an historical trace of the distinctive &lsquo;Wosk&rsquo; blue tiles which were a part of the Vancouver landscape for so long. The blue colour will also act as a beautiful counterpoint to the copper tones that are seen throughout Fraser Commons.\r\n\r\nMother and Child will invite interaction at the ground level of the community but will also have visual appeal when viewed from above.

The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named. \r\nMarega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in \"Roman bronze\". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting.\r\nAn interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley. \r\nMatthews: \"Mr. Townley, the \"Sun\" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it.\"\r\nTownley: \"What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the \"home for incurable dogs\", or some other idiotic thing\".\r\nMatthews: \"Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the \"Sun\" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.\"\r\nTownley: \"Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that...\"\r\nThe statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city's 115th birthday. The bill for cost of cleaning was $5800, almost the same amount as the original statue cost.

Known as \"Phifer's Fountain\", this work was commissioned in 1973 by the CPR and Marathon Realty to address a plaza of which the zoning panel of the day said \"a truly `civic square', as the developers propose, should be more generous and festive in concept.\" (Rezoning application, October 1968) This plaza was described in the 1969 development permit application as \"developed with trees, sitting area, fountain, grass mounds, architectural lighting, etc.\" Somewhere along the line, the \"fountain\" turned into a 30 foot by 60 foot sculpture.\r\n\"The CPR went to Washington State to find someone to design these columns of squared timber to represent, in abstract form, BC forests. The wood used would supply enough timber to build 10 homes.\" (A Guide to Sculpture in Vancouver, Peggy Imredy, 1980)\r\nBy 2002, some of these columns had deteriorated substantially and Marathon wanted to redevelop the plaza.

The design was originally created in 1936 for the Sheet Metal Workers Local 280 float for the Pacific National Exhibition Jubilee Parade on the occasion of the City of Vancouver's 50th birthday. It was designed by Lew Parry and made into a sculpture, built by Neon Products, which was sited at the first Vancouver Air Terminal from 1939 to 1972 when it was scrapped because of rust. In 1985 the Vancouver Transportation Club and the Sheet Metal Workers Union 280 decided to build a replica to celebrate Vancouver's 100th birthday. They located Lew Parry and he still had the original plans. This time the rocketship was built from more durable materials by Terminal Sheet Metal and the Local 280 metal workers. The Rocket was exhibited at Expo 86 and then donated to the city. It was moved by helicopter to it's current site. A Centennial Time Capsule is housed in the base of the rocket, scheduled to be opened 50 years from 1986. It includes items such as an Expo 86 passport with stamps of all the pavilions and recorded messages from local celebrities and many other things.\r\nThe City accepted the Centennial Rocket and a site was found for it in the small plaza at the SW end of the Cambie Street bridge.  -information from the website of SMW280", "type": "Sculpture", "status": "In place", "primarymaterial": "stainless steel & bronze", "geo_local_area": "Fairview", "artists": "115", "photocredits": "Lilli Wong", "yearofinstallation": "1986", "sitename": "Cambie Street Plaza", "siteaddress": "Cambie Street", "photourl": {"id": "328ce7beb3b0e91b2e4b2f7b43444daf", "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 667, "width": 1024, "filename": "L178-115-Centennial_Rocket-Lilli_Wong.jpg", "thumbnail": true, "format": "JPEG", "color_summary": ["rgba(139, 166, 213, 1.00)", "rgba(80, 95, 115, 1.00)", "rgba(130, 151, 192, 1.00)"]}, "locationonsite": "South end of Cambie St. Bridge, W. side of bridge entrance", "geom": {"coordinates": [-123.115347, 49.266071], "type": "Point"}, "neighbourhood": "Fairview", "url": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=178"}, "record_timestamp": "2022-03-28T05:23:32.479-07:00"},{"datasetid": "public-art", "recordid": "719d395cfb01ecca04ac2ad3c185cc0c75526ecf", "fields": {"ownership": "City of Vancouver", "registryid": 182, "type": "Sculpture", "status": "In place", "primarymaterial": "Bronze", "geo_local_area": "Hastings-Sunrise", "artists": "241", "photocredits": "Barbara Cole", "yearofinstallation": "1967", "sitename": "Pacific National Exhibition Grounds", "siteaddress": "3100 E.

They hang in pairs along both sides of Victoria between 39th and 49th Avenues, providing decorative highlights against the backdrop of local businesses and shops. - Park Board web site", "registryid": 258, "descriptionofwork": "Banners are installed along Victoria Drive  to beautify and mark the neighbourhood.", "type": "Two-dimensional artwork", "status": "No longer in place", "primarymaterial": "Main street awning/industrial fabric", "geo_local_area": "Kensington-Cedar Cottage", "artists": "281;295", "yearofinstallation": "1999", "sitename": "Victoria Drive", "siteaddress": "Victoria Drive from  39th to 49th Avenue", "photourl": {"id": "d0a99b5fbee9d02975d7f523f9fcfafe", "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 250, "width": 333, "filename": "LAW258-1.jpg", "thumbnail": true, "format": "JPEG", "color_summary": ["rgba(140, 115, 107, 1.00)", "rgba(121, 95, 88, 1.00)", "rgba(149, 148, 145, 1.00)"]}, "locationonsite": "On poles in the commerical areas of Victoria Drive", "geom": {"coordinates": [-123.0654, 49.234972], "type": "Point"}, "neighbourhood": "Kensington-Cedar Cottage", "url": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=258"}, "record_timestamp": "2022-03-28T05:23:32.479-07:00"},{"datasetid": "public-art", "recordid": "1f754f1f6e3bdc6a8e978b5f56094e453c6b6e60", "fields": {"ownership": "Queen Victoria School", "artistprojectstatement": "Each Queen Victoria student created a design from which two tiles were made....

Finally, the 40 colour fields of stone aggregate, which overlay and unite all the elements, are abstractions of colour maps made of the Milky Ways' \"cosmic sea.\" The recurring fours and forties and their multiples in the work refer to wholeness, totality, and completion (appropriate for a work completed at the end of the millennium).\" (From news release for public opening ceremony)", "registryid": 313, "descriptionofwork": "Integrated into the public walkway through the Lions Developement at 1300 West Georgia, is a plaza incorporating fibre optic lights, mosaic swirls, and 3 large bronze castings of cargo ships seen from above.

The colorful swirls represent other galaxies and deep space objects, and the boats allude both to the actual cargo ships found in Vancouver's harbour and to mankind's use of the stars as navigation tools.     \r\nKerr's sculpture was commissioned by the developer of the site after a competition sanctioned by the Vancouver Public Art Committee.

These \"stars\" are each set into a black granite star shaped tile and each constellation is further defined by lines of polished brass set into the aggregate.

Although we can identify in general with Vancouver as 'our city', as belonging to the public, space in the city is clearly delineated: either it belong to you or id doesn't.  The space along Nanaimo is technically public space, and unlike the neighbouring yards, anyone can go on this space.  However, in the larger scheme of things, do we feel entitled to it as a space?  We're interested in drawing attention to the public nature of this space and the claims made on the city.  Related to these ideas, this artwork addresses the ephemeral, shifting nature of the site, both in terms of the physical environment and cultural priorities.

Spanning four stories of the building, Double Blind  translates a Snellen, or eye, chart into Braille by using dome mirrors in order to emulate the raised dots of Braille script.\r\n\r\nDome mirrors are endemic to public spaces and can be found in pedestrian underpasses, hospital corridors, and in commercial retail contexts. They are used for surveillance as well as for the prevention of collisions in pedestrian traffic flow. Public space is often highly contested since it must typically answer to the idealist demands of communal space while also satisfying the concerns for public safety that are frequently associated with control and surveillance. Like many atriums, the new Vancouver Community College\u2019s interior public space has a panoptic tendency: emphasizing \u2018insight\u2019 into various interior spaces from specific vantage points. This panoptic tendency is echoed in the domed mirrors, each reflecting a 360\u00b0 view of the surrounding space.\r\n\r\nDouble Blind deliberately and emphatically utilizes elements that are commonly found in public space and re-purposes them, thereby highlighting the quality of the space itself, rather than offering a pictorial escape from its reality. Double Blind queries the interlinked ideas of seeing and controlling, acknowledging the importance of the context in which information is acquired and processed, whether that context is a scientific doctrine, social matrix, or language system.\r\n\r\nThis sculptural work is accompanied by a T-shirt multiple that echoes the installation\u2019s oxymoronic premise: those who can see the work likely don\u2019t read braille, and those who read braille can probably not see the work.\r\n\r\nOn the back of each T-shirt, an eye chart is rendered in raised letters.

Instant Coffee has a reclaimed aesthetic and a social intention that played out over the four components: Blanket Bus; Instant Coffee 500; Say Nothing in Bright Colours; and Instant Coffee Light Bar Bus Shelter. All the components functioned as short moments of reprieve as visual fields that are most typically reserved for advertising. Even though Instant Coffee often formally plays with the style of advertising it does so without a clear focused point of sale.\r\n\r\nFor Blanket Bus, Instant Coffee re-positioned and re-scaled the typical hand crafted afghan blanket, wrapping five sides of an articulated bus with large realistic photo images of the blankets. With its erratic and saturated palette and its repetitive grid line and block form, this vernacular aesthetic of the afghan was synthetically ripe, easily appropriated from its modest domestic crafting place and resituated at a larger scale into a public space, one of advertising. Since the artist collective's inception in 2000, Instant Coffee has used language as part of their practice, designing slogans like \"it doesn't have to be good to be meaningful and \"get social or get lost.\" It is through succinct catchphrases, which at times drip with the sincerity of self-help jargon, ring with the urgings of advertising slogans or resound with a dissonant irony, that Instant Coffee applies to Say Nothing in Bright Colours, a series of seven individually hand painted sandwich boards that will be permanently installed in various locations along Main St in Vancouver. \r\n\r\nInstant Coffee often invites other artists to participate in their projects and they continued this tradition for Instant Coffee 500, where they asked 14 artists to design 16 interior car ad cards to be displayed in one bus. Instant Coffee then asked bus patrons to vote on which artist ad card they like best. For two weeks, transit riders voted on their favorite design via text messaging and online.  The winning artist received a $500.00 prize and their design was featured on the outside of another number three Main Street bus for the remainder of the project. For the Light Bar Bus Shelter, Instant Coffee adapted the Main and West 20th bus shelter into a full spectrum light therapy bar. In a place, such as Vancouver, Canada, with much darkness and rain, the negative effects from this lack of sunlight has on individual psyches and the larger social milieu seems at times seems paramount.

Yero&rsquo;s project was visible from the street during the day through the window of Access Gallery. Peering through a revealed slot in the otherwise darkened window the viewer will experience intense flashes of light, created by flickering LED lights which momentarily highlight knife blades set against a black backdrop in a completely darkened room. The brief beams of light on the spikes of metal suggest the reflection of light created from a lighthouse beacon, announcing a vast dark sea. Engaging the individual senses, yet disorientating the viewer and evoking the feeling of being alone in the middle of a dark ocean at night, the work offered a sense of solitude within the public space of the street. Its contrasting beauty and brutality also incited inevitable reflections about violence and self-preservation in the marginalized neighbourhood in which the work is situated. As an immigrant to Canada from Cuba, Yero has consistently been concerned with themes that relate to his experience as part of the growing Cuban diaspora. Since living in Canada, Yero still frequently visits his homeland, where many of his family and friends continue to live with limited possibilities to leave. Like the paradoxical freedom and panic that swimming in a wide dark ocean may induce, Cubans are legally bound to their country, which is both home and prison. Many who try to escape across the ocean do not survive, or arrive on the other side only to be returned. The metaphor of death prevails in Yero&rsquo;s practice. The title of the work, Passage, reflects these ideas &ndash; water is evoked as the dual possibility of freedom and death. This work also addresses myriad issues of integration and dislocation facing immigrants to a new country. Exhibited during a global event promoting nationalistic pride through marketing terms such as &ldquo;dream,&rdquo; &ldquo;discover,&rdquo; and &ldquo;celebrate,&rdquo; the installation in turn speaks to the underlying complexities of these utopic ideals.", "registryid": 471, "descriptionofwork": "Sculptural light installation", "type": "Media work", "status": "No longer in place", "primarymaterial": "LED lights, knives, enclosed room", "geo_local_area": "Downtown", "artists": "341", "yearofinstallation": "2010", "sitename": "Access Gallery", "siteaddress": "206 Carrall Street", "photourl": {"id": "0049c0f5562814d97639b6d6a7616f01", "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 235, "width": 350, "filename": "LAW471-1.jpg", "thumbnail": true, "format": "JPEG", "color_summary": ["rgba(35, 34, 38, 1.00)", "rgba(54, 50, 48, 1.00)", "rgba(34, 29, 25, 1.00)"]}, "locationonsite": "Front window of gallery", "geom": {"coordinates": [-123.103934, 49.282989], "type": "Point"}, "neighbourhood": "DowntownEastside", "url": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=471"}, "record_timestamp": "2022-03-28T05:23:32.479-07:00"},{"datasetid": "public-art", "recordid": "4b35e2c952b8e89f763349e1c6fff33f1d773203", "fields": {"ownership": "City of Vancouver", "registryid": 477, "descriptionofwork": "Animated by lead-artist Bryan Mulvill, Centre A hosted the World Tea Party, a social, interactive gathering space that acts as a work of art.

There are two components: a large-scale projection in public space, and an interior projection within the gallery fed by a live surveillance camera. By using participants\u2019 video clips documenting the Vancouver 2010 Olympic, Paralympic and related events, viewers are asked to consider the ways in which the International Olympic Committee and the City of Vancouver is represented officially, and the alternative views that are largely dismissed, or written over, by the spectacle machine, which serves to homogenize the Canadian subjectivity. Issues explored are surveillance versus sousveillance, the ways in which we watch events, the ways in which we watch each other and the ways in which we are being watched.\r\n\r\nParticipation consisted simply of video documenting the Olympic, Paralympic and Torch Relay events with cell phones (or any other video capturing device) and the clips were submitted by email and larger files were uploaded to an ftp site. The files were automatically pulled from the inbox and inserted into the video line-up at fifteen minute intervals. These clips were then projected onto the Gallery building, in a gated and locked courtyard, mimicing the inaccessibility of the Olympics. The people could gather on the sidewalk to watch the projection, and that area was monitored by the surveillance camera, which was projected on the wall in the gallery by a live. The gallery audience was essentially watching the audience outside watching the projection of the audience watching the Olympics. \r\n\r\nThere is a two-part archival book project that accompanies the work and is available online at www.liddlethought.blogspot.com. The first part includes contextual texts by Kristina Lee Podesva and Danna Vajda  and images of the Torch Relay. The second part of the book will be available in April. It will function as an archive of the event as it unfolds over the time of the Olympic and Paralympic games. This book project will not only document the work, it will also function as a vehicle for the dissemination of the representations collected that provide an alternate view of the \u201cofficial\u201d versions sanctioned and circulated by VANOC and the City of Vancouver. Multiple subjectivities will add complexity to this overarching image of Vancouver. \r\n\r\nRina Liddle is a visual artist, researcher and educator.

But the work also responds to the architecture of the building which is constructed of glass all the way around apart from the concrete core. The two towers are connected by a lower section between them. The building is not rectangular but instead protrudes at different angles drawing diagonal lines in the glass facade. These angles can be seen as mountain peaks and they became the starting point for the light design. Led light lines were mounted on the concrete core horizontally. The lines reveal 40 different preset modes which have been uploaded to the rgb modules. One state is a graphic pattern of a single angle that meets up with angle of the building representing the sihouette of a mountain. This image remains the same but the colors change very gradually. The flow of the colors was inspired by the changes of the seasons and the changes of the day. They blend into each other with fades making the transitions look natural as part of the environment. The graphic state is sometimes intercepted by a dynamic state where a motion is simulated of water running down the building.

Since childhood, every time I\u2019ve driven down it, I\u2019ve been creeped out by the scary 1930s and 1940s industrial structures to the south \u2014 by the endless repetitive loop of fast food and dead underwatered lawns, and by its overabundance of appallingly cheap commercial architecture. In my mind, when children die, their ghosts went to work inside those scary brick buildings. Inside the fast food joints, the fare was probably saltier and greasier than anywhere else, and if you went into one of the businesses or professional buildings, cults would hand you religious pamphlets, and when you left, your clothing would smell like your grandmother\u2019s front hall cupboard and a moldy copy of Life magazine with Pat Nixon on the cover.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been watching the strip\u2019s ongoing redevelopment over the past decade, and while I\u2019m glad it\u2019s finally changing, I\u2019ve been slightly unsure of what it\u2019s changing into. The stores are now big and clean and shiny and no longer coma inducing \u2014 but maybe every time you buy something there, a penguin dies in Antarctica or a tree is chopped down up north, never to be replanted? Well, that\u2019s just me being morbid. It\u2019s now actually much better than it was before \u2014 the air of unipolar depression is gone \u2014 replaced by the early 21st century\u2019s version of perfected retail, that of inventory-optimized big box shopping. The city has also kept what little good architecture there was and is making a definite attempt to green the place up. So when it came time to think of something for this location, I thought, \u2018Why not revel in the consumer fantasia that is the Big Box?\u2019  To do something earnest or minimal in the way that we expect public art to be seemed like a defeatist strategy. Anything sparse or overly cerebral would be optically clubbed to death by a staggering amount of colorful signage, and a chance to say something exciting or uplifting about the place would be lost in a possible miasma of jargon and Corten steel slabs.\r\n\r\nCanadian Tire is a store about possibilities; we all know the wonderful sense of creative omnipotence we feel walking down the aisles: Oh, the things I could do with those slats! And why, are those thin-veneer doors useful as tabletops? And look! An eight-can paint-shaker! We know the smell of fertilizer, plywood and galvanized nails. And we most of all know the smell of rubber tires \u2014 the smell of long-chain carbon molecules off-gassing in a way that no ventilation system can ever fight. And in Canadian Tire, the rubber you smell is possibly a Motomaster whitewall, and that\u2019s what Infinite Tire is: a Brancusi-esque expression of joy in all things suburban, a wink to the notion of better living through abundance, and a totem of sorts that acknowledges and revels in the choices and creative freedom that can be inherent in industrial sizing systems.\" - Douglas Coupland, 2012", "registryid": 526, "type": "Sculpture", "status": "In place", "artists": "391", "photocredits": "Emma Peter", "yearofinstallation": "2012", "sitename": "Canadian Tire", "siteaddress": "26 South West Marine Drive", "photourl": {"id": "4fa66f210fc77ef34bf5760d07758e8d", "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 861, "width": 1024, "filename": "LPhotoEmmaPeter3.JPG", "thumbnail": true, "format": "JPEG", "color_summary": ["rgba(18, 34, 88, 1.00)", "rgba(85, 110, 166, 1.00)", "rgba(132, 119, 94, 1.00)"]}, "neighbourhood": "Marpole", "url": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=526"}, "record_timestamp": "2022-03-28T05:23:32.479-07:00"},{"datasetid": "public-art", "recordid": "aff0e89e77f851945fd544ebe7f0870a553e2679", "fields": {"ownership": "Privately owned", "registryid": 527, "descriptionofwork": "The 7,200 square foot mural is a depiction of orcas.", "type": "Mural", "status": "No longer in place", "geo_local_area": "Downtown", "artists": "216", "photocredits": "Photo Credit - Rachel Topham", "yearofinstallation": "1994", "sitename": "Old Continental Hotel (Downtown)", "siteaddress": "1290 Granville Street (Downtown)", "photourl": {"id": "5ab390e2f92c41912c1f235b25be5f7c", "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 238, "width": 350, "filename": "LAW527-1.jpg", "thumbnail": true, "format": "JPEG", "color_summary": ["rgba(128, 150, 170, 1.00)", "rgba(97, 120, 128, 1.00)", "rgba(77, 109, 114, 1.00)"]}, "locationonsite": "Exterior, south wall", "geom": {"coordinates": [-123.1276, 49.276384], "type": "Point"}, "neighbourhood": "Downtown", "url": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=527"}, "record_timestamp": "2022-03-28T05:23:32.479-07:00"},{"datasetid": "public-art", "recordid": "b1ae7a3750e0723d66cbd633dc7f7dbe8c922d4b", "fields": {"ownership": "City of Vancouver", "artistprojectstatement": "\u201cAs an urban indigenous person calling Vancouver home for many years, I wanted to honour the First Peoples history and Musqueam, Squamish and Tsail-wututh Nations with my work...

There are windows on two sides, adding to the illusion of some kind of use value implicit to its presence on the site. The windows are utilitarian, institutional, industrial, with frosted security glass containing wire that obscure a direct line of site into the structure. Within the pavilion is a single, dim light. The pavilion sits immediately to the east of the entrance to the Meccanica development on the corner of First Avenue and Quebec Street in Vancouver, BC. The design borrows from the artdeco influenced electrical substations that are interwoven in Vancouver\u2019s urban fabric. The piece looks as if it has been a long-term tenant of the site, as if it belongs to the area and is a relic of an earlier age. The illusion of its permanence is ruptured by a number of elements that disturb a simple and seamless inclusion in the local vernacular. The pavilion\u2019s design references utility and yet as a consequence of the breaking up of vertical relations within the piece it becomes obvious\r\nsomething else is going on. What possible use could be made of a structure that seems to have no level floor, let alone barely enough room to turn around in? Why would so much attention be paid to the design of such a small and inconsequential piece of infrastructure?\r\nSubstation Pavilion\u2019s design hints at the networks of subterranean connections with the rest of the city and with the past of the site itself. The entire area of False Creek consisted of a marshy wetland prior to its infill. This program of \u2018reclaiming\u2019 the tidal areas of Vancouver allowed for the development of the rail yards and industrial infrastructure at the east end of False Creek. This established a horizontal approach to looking at and moving through the growing city, tied as it was to these rail lines. The vertical tendencies of this project aim to introduce the rupturing of the quotidian relationship with the horizontal that dominates movement through the city. The strata formed in the soil of the False Creek area carry the history of the settlement of the area. The networks of the rail yards spread the stories of the people passing through them,\r\ncreating layers within the cultural memory of the city. Over the years this cultural detritus molds and rots just as the soil and the structures of the area do. Together they form a humus that\r\ncontains the mold that supports life in the city, spreading underneath every structure we build and every story we tell. This is a fertile substrate, not one given to decay and destruction. It supports connections and unexpected developments, much as the rhizomorphic systems of a large fungus will remain hidden, spreading underground and only exhibiting its presence once a\r\nyear with its short-lived mushroom heads. It is a constantly shifting and ever-present narrative running just below the surface of the city.\r\nCedric Bomford\r\nOctober, 2014", "registryid": 591, "descriptionofwork": "Concrete Pavilion", "type": "Sculpture", "status": "In place", "primarymaterial": "Ductal concrete", "geo_local_area": "Mount Pleasant", "artists": "486", "photocredits": "Michael Love", "yearofinstallation": "2014", "sitename": "Meccanica", "siteaddress": "108 East 1st Avenue", "photourl": {"id": "5483583eadb0a5d0db15ea0dfb86f246", "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1397, "width": 1024, "filename": "LCedric Bomford - Substation Pavillion - Img1 - Photo by Michael Love.JPG", "thumbnail": true, "format": "JPEG", "color_summary": ["rgba(113, 113, 115, 1.00)", "rgba(113, 112, 109, 1.00)", "rgba(110, 114, 115, 1.00)"]}, "locationonsite": "South side of First Avenue", "geom": {"coordinates": [-123.10182, 49.270023], "type": "Point"}, "neighbourhood": "Mount Pleasant", "url": "https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=591"}, "record_timestamp": "2022-03-28T05:23:32.479-07:00"},{"datasetid": "public-art", "recordid": "944c9f85c0d49bb26a28b9a5ba7443c2ec08ff1d", "fields": {"ownership": "Bosa", "artistprojectstatement": "At once romantic and fantastic, Nail Farm seeks to reconcile the desire to satisfy city-self and country-self, the inherent drive in urban agriculture.

Four delicate lines of dichroic glass are integrated into the southeast and southwest facades to bring nuances of shifting colour to viewers. The hues are affected by climatic and light modulations in the sky. Like weather and emotion, all is in a constant state of change.
